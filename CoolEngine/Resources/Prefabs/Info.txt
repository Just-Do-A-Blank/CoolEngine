Prefabs are single object saves.
Add a key on some objects.
Save the key and then hit save to create the file.
When you save the scene it will save the key with the game object.
On Scene load it will load the prefab with the scene.

Keep in mind:
1. Whilst editing, Prefabs are still game objects so hit load to update to the prefab version!
2. There is no type protection so if you enter save an enemy prefab on the player it just won't load any player properties. Defaults would load.
3. It's just a single object saver.
